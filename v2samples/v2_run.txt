User:  Nice, give me a recipe for spaghetti and meatballs.
Assistant:  Here is a classic recipe for spaghetti and meatballs:

Ingredients:

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 egg
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 cans (14 oz each) crushed tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 pound spaghetti
- Grated Parmesan cheese for serving

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, egg, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. Shape the mixture into meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter.

2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook until browned on all sides, about 6-8 minutes. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set aside.

3. In the same skillet, add the diced onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, sugar, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer.

4. Return the meatballs to the skillet, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through.

5. In the meantime, cook the spaghetti according to package instructions. Drain the spaghetti and divide among serving plates.

6. Top the spaghetti with the meatballs and sauce. Serve hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese.

Enjoy your delicious spaghetti and meatballs!
