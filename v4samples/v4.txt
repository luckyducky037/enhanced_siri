In this version, I've added a YOLOv9 visual component to this betterSiri, and combined the NLP and CV aspects into one file. Commented out the call-and-response function and replaced it with a simple return key wait function. Unnecessarily complex pluralization of different COCO objects for use in insertion in the prompt. Moved to OpenAI-powered text-to-speech API, although the voice is albeit a little creepy.
