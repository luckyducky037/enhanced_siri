This is my attempt at an enhanced version of Siri by implementing a LLM API.

V1: Used Goose AI, and sucked really badly.

V2: Used paid OpenAI API, and worked much better. Still lacks the more useful aspects of current Siri.

V3: Some basic Siri functions (call, text, date / time, Google search, open URL); a rather lacking call-and-response function.

V4: Added YOLOv9-powered computer vision capabilities; removed call-and-response in favor of key activation.
